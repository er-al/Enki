# What is MCP?
- Allow LLM to access personal API

# MCP has client and server


# Two built-in MCP transports:
1. STDIO 
 - Standard input/output -  Best for local dev or command-line tools.

2. Streamable HTTP (SSE) - Used in production. It sends HTTP POST requests from the client to server, and uses Server-Sent Events to stream back responses.
