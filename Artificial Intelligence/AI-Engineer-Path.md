# Intro to AI Engineering
- OpenAI launch 2015, but burst into public around 2022 
- Revolutionized our concept of what AI can do.


### Large Language Model
- is an algorithm that uses  training data to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions.

<br>

### Models
- model snapshot
- context length
- cut-off date
- memory 


<br>
## Prompt Engineering
- designing inputs for generative AI tools to produce optimal outputs.
