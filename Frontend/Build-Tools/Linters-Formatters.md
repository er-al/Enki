# Linters formatters
- Find errors, bugs and style issues by checkgn code against rules.
- Formatters automatically fix style, like **indents** and **spacing**.
- Help code consistent, readable, and catch errors early.


## Linters are way more valuable for interpreted languages since there's no compiler to detect errors during development time.

## Benefits:
1. Fewer errors in production
2. Readable, maintainable, and more consistent code
3. Fewer discussions about code style and aesthetic choices during code reviews.
4. Objective measurement of code quality
5. More secure and performant code.
6. Education about code quality reaches more developers.

## Type of Checks Linters Provide
1. Syntax Errors
2. Code Standard Adherence
3. Code Standards Adherence
4. Potential Problems (aka Code Smells)
5. Security Checks

## Understanding Static Analysis
- pre-run debug
- Consists of tools that analyzes your source code looking for errors, lack of adherence to rules or conventions, or other potential problems.

## Example of Linters
1. Linters for Static Analysis - (StandardJs, PHPMD, StyleCop)
2. Linters for Security - (Gosec, Bandit, LGTM)
3. Linteers for Coding Conventions / Code Formatting - (Prettier, Rubocop, StyleCop)
